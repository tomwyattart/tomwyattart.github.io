</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Hi folks!
I want to change my career path and become a Data Scientist working with AI. But, generally, I'd like to grow and become a better human being for myself and others, and I hope this forum is a place where I can follow this journey with some fantastic people like you!</p>
<p>Since this is my first post, I'd like to share my personal story and motivation. I've grown in the sense of duty that I need to get a job and unburden my family with the need to support me. Hence I took any job I could and studied IT in the meantime. Eventually, I got a job in IT, which was very important for me because I became self-reliant. I used to not think about self-actualization back then, so I didn't look at what I would do. I just wanted to have the money to pay my checks. Since the easiest way to get a job as a Front-end Developer, I've become one. In the meantime, after much though times, however, I eventually found a lovely woman and married her :)
I am enormously happy with my personal life, but I feel stuck in my career. I am constantly fixing some minor front-end bugs. I'm sure IT engineers who read it know what I mean :) </p>
<p>I have limited time and resources because I need to support my family initially, but I'd love to change my career from Front-end Dev to Data Scientist. I already have strong Python skills, SQL, database, and data scraping knowledge. I am also good at working with libraries that present the data. However, I am utterly blind to things like Analytics, Statistics, and Machine Learning, not talking about Deep Neural Networks. </p>
<p>When I look for how to become Data Scientist, I find tons of resources, and the number of them makes it harder to pick up the right thing. On the other hand, working with people and receiving feedback from them motivates me. Hence I'd like to ask you about courses, books, and resources one can take to get its first Data Science job eventually. Where should I start? </p>
<p>To organize me better and to be closer to people, which helps me stay motivated, I created a blog and this post. My blog will always be Open Sourced, so you can Open a PR with any suggestion or post it on Reddit. I'll keep you up to date, and I hope I won't be alone on this journey thanks to you. </p>                </article>
